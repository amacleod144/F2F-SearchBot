# F2F-SearchBot
This project was started to create a bot that could find the Canadian price of an entire Magic the Gathering deck. 
Many alternatives exist for adding up deck values based on American prices, but none for Canadian. Canadian Magic card prices are generally 
set by the largest online retailer of Magic cards in Canada, facetofacegames.com. This bot takes as input a list of cards, accesses their site, and 
returns a total price.

The bot is written in python 3.7 and makes use of such libraries as BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Selenium.
